    "The neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis have complementary circadian rhythms: on weekdays, Ultimate Gotham is most active at night, and Ultimate Metropolis is most active during the day. On weekends, there is reasonable activity in both cities. \n",
    "However, a toll bridge, with a two way toll, between the two cities causes driver partners to tend to be exclusive to each city. The Ultimate managers of city operations for the two cities have proposed an experiment to encourage driver partners to be available in both cities, by reimbursing all toll costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would you choose as the key measure of success of this experiment in encouraging driver partners to serve both cities, and why would you choose this metric?\n",
    "I would choose weekend engagement for drivers in the city other than their primary weekday city. With the huge difference in peak times during the weekdays, it is unlikely that any driver would take advantage of both cities as that would equate to working more than 12 hours a day. However, with weekends being active for both throughout the day, it is more reasonable to expect a driver to take customers back and forth with tolls not being an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a practical experiment you would design to compare the effectiveness of the proposed change in relation to the key measure of success. Please provide details on: a. how you will implement the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "b. what statistical test(s) you will conduct to verify the significance of the observation\n",
    "\n",
    "c. how you would interpret the results and provide recommendations to the city operations team along with any caveats. Prior to any announcements, I would track drivers' (I'm not sure how large the driver pool is, but tracking all of them initially would be helpful) city habits both on weekdays and weekends. Which cities are they spending the majority of their time, or are they split. Then I would inform all of them (the prior weeks serves as the control and it would be difficult to be sure drivers did not share the information if only a selection were chosen) of the changed toll policy. Again, their trips per city would be tracked. It would be especially noteworthy to note how many times the city location changes per day. I would use a t-test to compare the average number of trips back and forth as well as trips in the non-weekday city. I would also compute an effect size as the number of trips may make it easy to find significance so that we know if the difference is meaningful. If the the effect size is greater than .25 I would then compute an actual cost analysis to see if the cost of the program is outweighed by the extra money brought in. With both of those true I would encourage the policy to be made permanent."
